# Definition of Done

A "Definition of Done" is a well-defined set of criteria that a software development team has agreed upon to determine when a task, story, or feature is considered complete. It ensures that the team and stakeholders are aligned on what is expected from the deliverables of a particular sprint or release.

- **Functional requirements:** The feature must meet all of the functional requirements that were specified in the user story or task.
- **Non-functional requirements:** The feature must meet all of the non-functional requirements, such as performance, scalability, security, and usability.
- **Code quality:** The code must adhere to the team's coding standards, be well-documented, and have passed all relevant tests.
- **Acceptance criteria:** The feature must meet all of the acceptance criteria that were defined for the user story or task.
- **Review and approval:** The feature must be reviewed and approved by the product owner or other relevant stakeholders.
- **Integration and deployment:** The feature must be integrated into the existing system and deployed to the production environment.
